			For our groupâ€™s project, we are aggregating National Basketball
			Association (NBA) data, specifically season statistics for players as well as projected
			draft and actual draft results and using various resources and techniques, including
			ones that we have learned in this class so far, to analyze and display our findings using
			graphical and table representations. The python code and ipython notebook that was used to generate the tables is located at <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rentaow/project498/blob/master/draft_PER/draft_pos_rating.ipynb">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rentaow/project498/blob/master/draft_PER/draft_pos_rating.ipynb</a>.

			This table provides two types of analytics given per draft position. It describes the expected performance of any draft position. It also tells us what are the chances a player picked at this position is a star player.

			We used a simple rating system (RTG) for grouping players:

			<table class="table table-condensed table-bordered table-hover" id = "table-rating">
				<tr>
					<th> Rating (RTG) </th>
					<th> Group </th>
				</tr>
				<tr class="success">
					<td> > 19.9 </td>
					<td> Star </td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="info">
					<td> 15.0 - 19.9 </td>
					<td> Solid </td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="active">
					<td> 10 - 14.9 </td>
					<td> Role Player </td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="warning">
					<td> 5 - 9.9 </td>
					<td> Bench Player </td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="error">
					<td> < 5 </td>
					<td> Bust </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> DNP </td>
					<td> Did Not Play </td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			This table is produced from aggregating players' career stats along with their draft position from the past 24 NBA seasons (90'-14'). We mined NBA players' stats from online databases and merged them into a single csv file. From these set of data we then produced average statistics for each draft position. We also created our own rating statistic (RTG) to measure players' performances.

		</div>	
			This part is intended to look into the value of each pick and more specifically which players were the best value for their pick position. The Rating differential is the stat we are calculating to see the players' value. It is the players Rating compared to the expected Rating of their pick position. The higher the rating differential, the greater the player out performed what is expected of them at their pick position. The players in this table is sorted by Rating differential in descending order.

			This table provides a look at how well a team has drafted based on a calculated Team Draft Rating statistic. This value is calculated by looking at each drafted players' career stats compared to the average stats for his draft number. The aggregate mean of the difference of each drafted player's Rating and the expected Rating for their pick position is used to calculate the Team Draft Rating. 

			Also shown are the number of stars, solid, bench players, etc drafted by each team from the number of picks they had.
